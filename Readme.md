# Hello, My name is Kurtis. ðŸ‘‹

  My life was filled with hurdles. The difficulties of life have taught me not to give up and become successful with any tasks given. I was faced with unemployment due to COVID - 19. It was another challenge to beat. But, here I am beating more challenges life has thrown my way and utilizing my skills and expending my knowledge to become a programmer.
